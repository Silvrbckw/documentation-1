====================
Flashing the SD Card
====================

In some circumstances, the IoT Boxâ€™s Micro SD Card may need to be reflashed to benefit from Odoo's
latest IoT image update.

Upgrade from the IoT Box homepage
=================================

Go to the IoT Box homepage, click on :guilabel:`Update`, next to the version number. If a new
version of the IoT Box image is available, a :guilabel:`Upgrade` button will appear at the
bottom of the page, the IoT Box will then flash itself to the new version of the IoT Box. All of the
previous configurations will be saved.

.. note::
   This process can take more than 30 minutes. Do not turn off or unplug the IoT Box as it would
   leave it in an inconsistent state.

Upgrade with Etcher
===================

.. note::
   A computer is required with a Micro SD card reader/adapter in order to reflash the Micro SD.

Go to Balena's website and download `Etcher <https://www.balena.io/>`__. It's a free and open-source
utility used for burning image files. Install and launch it. Download the latest IoT image from
`nightly <http://nightly.odoo.com/master/iotbox/>`__.

Then, open *Etcher* and select :guilabel:`Flash from file`, find the image just downloaded and
extracted. Insert the IoT Box Micro SD card into the computer or reader and select it. Click on
:guilabel:`Flash` and wait for the process to finish.

   An alternative software to flashing the Micro SD card with *Balena's Etcher* is using *Raspberry
   Pi Imager*. Download the software `here <https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/>`__
